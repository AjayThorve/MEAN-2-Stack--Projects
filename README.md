# MEAN-2-Stack--Projects
Some of the projects I created using mean-2 stack:
1. Simple UI which implements create,delete and insert opertions
2. Blog applications with images. Creat, insert, delete and update your articles. Authentication implemented, with access control to articles only written by users. Can view articles written by other users.
